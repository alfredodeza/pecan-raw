 An easy hook for the Pecan Web Framework that provides some information 
 in a per request basis for development purposes.

 Currently supported:

 * Request Method 
 * Request Response Status 
 * Request URL
 * Controller Method Hit
 * Pecan Context information 
 * Pecan Hooks enabled
 * Parameters
 
 It is not yet configurable since it only displays a small amount of data, but
 feature releases should include a way to properly configure the verbosity of the 
 output.

 Once installed, the proper way of adding it to your Pecan application is::

    from pecanraw import RawHook

    app = make_app(RootController(), hooks=[RawHook()]
